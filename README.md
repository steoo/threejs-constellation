# Constellation 

An experiment created with [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) and [drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei) in order to represent a constellation of stars, with words displayed in an elliptical distribution, play with controls, and to have fun. 

Also visualises things (through the use of helpers) which is IMO the hardest thing to do when working with three.js
